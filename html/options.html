      <h1>Core Functionality</h1>
      <h3>What is the primary purpose of the extension?</h3>
      The primary purpose of this extension is to allow a quick-access dropdown menu for Clearlink Consumer Brands Content teams and Consumer Brands Engineering teams to quickly navigate our sites through pages that we deem are “High Priority”, meaning they are high-traffic or high-revenue pages that we should make a habit of looking through often to make sure there are no visual or functional bugs on the page.

      The list of sites this Extension is intended for is:
      <ul>
        <li>highspeedinternet.com</li>
        <li>cabletv.com</li>
        <li>reviews.org</li>
        <li>satelliteinternet.com</li>
        <li>business.org</li>
        <li>safewise.com</li>
